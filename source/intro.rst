 About Fractal Tree
====================

TokuFT is a high-performance, transactional key-value store, used in the TokuDB storage engine for MySQL and MariaDB and in TokuMX, the high-performance MongoDB distribution.

TokuFT is provided as a shared library with an interface similar to Berkeley DB.

To build the full MySQL product, see the instructions for Tokutek/ft-engine. To build TokuMX, see the instructions for Tokutek/mongo. This document covers TokuFT only.
